        Tip Jar is a simple OPNET-powered app for sending token tips on OPNET. It lets you support
        creators and friends using OP20 tokens in a lightweight, self-custodial way.

        I built this app to explore what small, human-sized interactions on Bitcoin can feel like:
        lightweight, direct support without complicated UIs or dashboards. It&apos;s meant to be a
        minimal, focused experience that shows how OPNET contracts and OP20 tokens can be used for
        everyday appreciation, not just trading.
